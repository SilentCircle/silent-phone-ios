 Manages avatars for uuid and for groups
 
 All avatars are returned from SCAvatar objects cached in avatars dictionary.
 When avatar is requested for the first time SCAvatar instance is created, stored in avatars cache and avatar finding is started for the passed conversation
 
 Avatar images are stored square in chat directory once taken out of directory or generated they are rounded with [SCCImageUtilities roundAvatarImage:]
