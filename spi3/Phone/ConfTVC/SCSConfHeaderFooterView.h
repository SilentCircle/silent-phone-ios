/**
 * This class is a WIP. The original idea was to have a single reusable
 * UITableViewHeaderFooterView subclass which could provide optional
 * "alt" top and/or bottom views, with "Main" intended as a generic
 * tableView section header view.
 *
 * The original conference call controller had special "message" views
 * at the bottom of the Conference section and at the top of the Private
 * section, which would appear conditionally based on the count of call
 * cells in each section. 
 *
 * The original intent of this class was to provide the lower Private
 * section to display a "PRIVATE" section header, and on top of that
 * display a "message" view as if it belonged to the bottom of the 
 * Conference section, and optionally, display a Private "message" view
 * underneath. This was to be accomplished in some of the commented
 * methods with AutoLayout.
 *
 * Initial attempts to use this class as designed resulted in AutoLayout
 * errors and unexpected results, which led to commenting a number of
 * the features. Likely, the development of the tableView handling and 
 * proper conditions for section views display was causing at least some
 * of the problems.
 *
 * The GTD solution for the ConferenceVC was to simply use different
 * xibs for each of the three required views, with height and colors
 * laid out explicitly. 
 *
 * Note that the useMainHeaderStyle, useMainFooterStyle, and 
 * useBottomFooterStyle methods do work as expected and are used in the
 * (current version) of SCSConferenceTVC. The bgColor, font, textColor, 
 * and textAlign values are at the top of the .m as #defines. Would that
 * this class be extended, these would likely become properties 
 * optionally defined by the client.
