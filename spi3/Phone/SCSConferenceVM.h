/**
 * This class is a ViewModel for the call conferencing feature, in the
 * MVVM pattern, i.e., Model--View--ViewModel. In contrast to the 
 * conventional MVC pattern espoused by Apple, this view model 
 * mediates between a static data model (M) and the view layer which
 * includes view and view controller.
 *
 * This view model serves as datasource and delegate for the "view
 * collection" of the Conferencing feature, i.e., both UITableView and
 * UICollectionView "view collections" are supported by this class.
 *
 * (Note that throughout the documentation, "view collection" is the
 * abstract description of the collectionView or tableView.)
 *
 * This class implements an event queue for updating the view collection
 * for changes in state. The input "signals" are:
 * - SCPIncomingCallNotification
 * - SCPCallStateDidChangeNotification
 * - SCPZRTPDidUpdateNotification
 * - SCPCallDidEndNotification
 * which come from SCPCallManager, which bridges call events from the
 * Tivi engine into ObjC. And user-driven changes, for example pressing
 * the answer or end call buttons on a cell, or dragging a call cell
 * between sections.
 *
 * "Blocking" events, such as the user dragging a call cell, cause
 * SCSBlockOperation block instances to defer execution by storing them
 * in the private deferredOpsQueue array until blocking is complete.
 *
 * (SCSBlockOperation is a private NSBlockOperation subclass defined near
 * the top of the implementation file.)
 *
 * Note that a reload with animation operation must also block so that
 * we don't try to reload with animation while an animated reload is
 * already occurring.
 *
 * Two flags are implemented to track blocking state:
 * - isReloading
 * - isReordering
 *
 * isReloading:  A KVO listener is implemented on the isReloading property.
 * When the property value changes, if both isReloading and isReordering
 * are false, the listener invokes the fireDeferredOperations method.
 *
 * isReordering: this flag is set when the user begins dragging a call
 * cell, and cleared when the drag is finished. This flag prevents a
 * reload operation for an incoming call while the user is changing the
 * state of the view collection.
 *
 * 
 * ### History
 * This documents a first implementation. Several immediate refinements
 * are possible:
 * * More selective reloading for update and reload events:
 *   Reload events are:
 *   - new incoming (unanswered) and outgoing (ended) calls, to be 
 *     displayed in the inProgress section
 *   - user-driven moves:
 *     - between conference and private sections by dragging,
 *     - into and out of inProgress section by answering/ending call
 *
 *   Improvement:
 *   Currently, for every (animated) reload event, the nested arrays 
 *   datasource is completely reconstructed with the SCPCall objects 
 *   from SCPCallManager. Then the deltas are calculated for insertions
 *   and deletions to/from the several sections. Then the collection is
 *   reloaded in an animation block.
 *
 *   It might be better to reload only changed sections. For example,
 *   dragging is only permitted between Private and Conference sections.
 *   It may be possible to reload the inProgress section for incoming
 *   and outgoing calls while dragging.
 *
 *
 * * Better filtering of call state from state change signal:
 *   Incoming call, call ended, and zrtp update, notifications (signals)
 *   are straightforward. But call state update is rather nebulous.
 *   Not all SCPCallStateDidChangeNotifications are relevant from the 
 *   view collection perspective. 
 *
 *   Unfortunately, the current implementation of SCPCall does not 
 *   provide rich introspection into its state. Filtering appropriate to
 *   the view collection could be implemented in this class, or
 *   (preferrably) the SCPCall instance could exposed a fine-grained
 *   state interface.
