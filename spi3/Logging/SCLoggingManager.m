 * Note that we call the special SCFileManager setupLogsCache method
 * everytime, to ensure that the logs cache directory exists. Of course,
 * it will only create the directory the first time it is found not to
 * exist, but the file system harmlessly ignores the request if it is
 * found to already exist. 
 *
 * The special setup method for the logs cache is so that the
