 Notifications manager abstracts the local notification handling for incoming call and message notifications.
 
 Manager supports both the older UILocalNotification (up to iOS 9) framework and the new User Notification (iOS 10.0+) framework.
 
 There is an object of this class as a public property of the Switchboard singleton instance that is responsible for the notification handling
 throughout the app.
