/**
 SCPCallHelper acts like an intermediate between SCSRootViewController that
 receives the call requests from every point inside (and outside via Intents) SPi
 and SCPCallManager that actually makes -or not- the call.
 
 The purpose of SCPCallHelper is:
 
 a. To figure out and display a dial assist selector based on the options that user has already set.
 b. To delay the call until the user data have been fetched from the API.
 c. Check user permissions and fail gracefully (posts failure notification @see kSCPOutgoingCallRequestFailedNotification).
 d. No notify via the NSNotificationCenter any subscribed class (in our case SCSRootViewController),
    if the call request has been fulfilled (kSCPOutgoingCallRequestFulfilledNotification) or 
    failed due to permissions (kSCPOutgoingCallRequestFailedNotification).
