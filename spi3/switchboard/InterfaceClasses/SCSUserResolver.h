/**
 SCSUserResolver is responsible for enqueuing requests to
 the /v1/user/ endpoint and updating the database conversations
 with the fresh data coming from the server.
 
 The class also provides an in-memory cache of all the resolved
 users for getting the latest data fast.
 
 An instance of this class is always available via the Switchboard
 so there's no need of instantiating more than one objects of
 SCSUserResolver class.
