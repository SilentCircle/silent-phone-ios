/**
 SCPPasscodeManager deals with the passcode / TouchID authentication that the user can enable within the app
 
 It offers helper methods for TouchID detection and presentation and also ways to save/update/delete and evaluate a passcode that is saved in the keychain
 
 This class can be instantiated when needed.
 
 Also note that this passcode implementation is not cryptographically enforced but merely procedurally enforced.
 
 Upon user's activation, the app hides the messaging functionality behind a view that requires passcode / TouchID to disappear.

 @param localizedReason Application reason for authentication. This string must be provided in correct
                        localization and should be short and clear. It will be eventually displayed in
                        the authentication dialog subtitle. A name of the calling application will be
                        already displayed in title, so it should not be duplicated here.

 @param localizedFallbackTitle  Allows fallback button title customization. A default title "Enter Password" is used when
                                this property is left nil. If set to empty string, the button will be hidden.

 @param completion Reply block that is executed when policy evaluation finishes.
 
 @param success Reply parameter that is YES if the policy has been evaluated successfully or NO if
                the evaluation failed.

 @param error   Reply parameter that is nil if the policy has been evaluated successfully, or it contains
                error information about the evaluation failure.

 @warning   localizedReason parameter is mandatory and the call will throw NSInvalidArgumentException if
            nil or empty string is specified.

 Typical error codes returned by this call are:
 @li          LAErrorUserFallback if user tapped the fallback button
 @li          LAErrorUserCancel if user has tapped the Cancel button
 @li          LAErrorSystemCancel if some system event interrupted the evaluation (e.g. Home button pressed).
