/**
 * Simple checkbox control toggles checkmark image on touch down.
 *
 * The layout of the control and private ivar subviews, 
 * _boundingBox and _imageView, are laid out in IB with AutoLayout.
 * The _imageView container of the checkmark image should be positioned
 * to overlay the _boundingBox. The control may oversized to expose a
 * bigger tap target.
 * 
 * The control sets its private _boundingBox layer border with a width
 * of 2.0, and the borderColor is initially set white with 0.75 alpha. 
 *
 * The control adds itself and a handler method as a target/action pair
 * of itself, and adds/removes the _imageView checkmark image to toggle 
 * the checked and unchecked appearance on touch down. The isChecked
 * getter is true when the _imageView is not nil.
 *
 * Consumers of this control should add a target/action pair.
 *
 * The image is a private property, set to mask to the self view
 * tint color. The self tintColor setter is overridden to additionally
 * set the _boundingBox borderColor to the given tintColor.
