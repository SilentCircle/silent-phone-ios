/**
 Returns a new string made from the receiver by replacing characters which are
 reserved in a URI query with percent encoded characters.
 
 @discussion The following characters are not considered reserved in a URI query
 by RFC 3986:
 
 - Alpha "a...z" "A...Z"
 - Numberic "0...9"
 - Unreserved "-._~"
 
 In addition the reserved characters "/" and "?" have no reserved purpose in the
 query component of a URI so do not need to be percent escaped.

 Returns a new string made from the receiver by replacing characters which are

 percent encoded characters.
 
 @discussion The W3C HTML5 specification, section 4.10.22.5 URL-encoded form
 data percent encodes all characters except the following:
 
 - Space (0x20) is replaced by a "+" (0x2B)
 - Bytes in the range 0x2A, 0x2D, 0x2E, 0x30-0x39, 0x41-0x5A, 0x5F, 0x61-0x7A
 (alphanumeric + "*-._")
 
 @param plusForSpace Boolean, when true replaces space with a '+'
 otherwise uses percent encoding (%20). Default is false.
 
 @return Returns the encoded string, or nil if the transformation is not possible.
