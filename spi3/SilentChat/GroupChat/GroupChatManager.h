/**
 GroupChatManager
 
 For group changes to take effect we have to call applyGroupChanges:
 which will send a vector clock of only necessary group changes made 
 since last applyChanges call.

 All group chat commands come in groupCommand() containing a dictionary
 with the neccessary info. Group command types are defined at SCSConstants.h
 
 When there is no network all group commands are stacked in 
 stackedOfflineGroupCommands property and stored in NsUserDefaults.
 
 This class contains 3 Categories
 +UI - Everything for updating Chat UI when group status changes
 +Members - Contains class functions to return memberList with different variations
 +AvatarUpdate - Update avatar when someone is removed or added to group
