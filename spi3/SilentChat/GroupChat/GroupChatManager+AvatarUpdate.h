 Category that manages group avatar setting, storing and resetting
 
 To set Explicit avatar image on group use setExplicitAvatar:forGroup:
 uses same dictionary as passed from UIImagePickerController in didFinishPickingMediaWithInfo:
 From avatar image SCAttachment is created, and uploaded to cloud,
 
 when upload is done setExplicitAvatarWithAttachmentDict:inGroup: on GroupChatManager is called passing cloud_url and cloud_key. These parameters are passed to zina call setGroupAvatar() which will send them to other group participants
 
 
 When avatar update is received parseReceivedAvatar:forGroup: is called
 It creates SCAttachment from received cloud_url and cloud_key parameters, downloads attachments TOC, downloads full attachment and decrypt's it.
 Then asigns decrypted image to RecentObject and display's alertView that avatar was updated.
 SCAttachment is not saved at any point image is stored when added to REcentObject, SCLoud cache is cleared from attachment's segments
 
 
 
 When explicitly set avatar is removed resetGeneratedAvatarForGroup:showAlert: is called 
 It reset's hasGroupAvatarBeenSetExplicitly flag on RecentObject, generates avatar from current member's in group and save's it over the old avatar in chat directory.
 Group status message is created saying that group avatar was removed.
 
 
 When member count in group changes because someone was added or removed updateGroupAvatarWithCommandDict: is called
 It calculates correct member list depending on whether user was added or removed and generates new avatar from memberlist
